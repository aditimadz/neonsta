Neonsta – Decentralized Social Blogging Platform

Neonsta is a decentralized platform that brings social blogging to the blockchain. Designed for transparency, user autonomy, and privacy, Neonsta enables content creators to own their work and interact with others in a censorship-resistant, trustless environment. Say goodbye to centralized control and hello to content freedom!

🚀 Build

Neonsta is a decentralized, user-controlled platform that provides the following:

Decentralized Content: Blog posts and user interactions are stored on the Neo blockchain.

User Ownership: Full control over your content—no one can delete or alter it.

Censorship Resistant: No single entity can suppress content. Neonsta ensures that creators own their voice.

Tokenized Reward System: Users earn tokens for creating engaging content and interacting with others.


🎯 Features

Social Blogging: Write and publish blog posts on a blockchain-backed platform.

Rewards System: Earn rewards based on content engagement (likes, comments, shares).

End-to-End Decentralization: Posts and interactions are stored on the blockchain, ensuring privacy and censorship resistance.

Smart Contracts: Powered by Neo smart contracts to handle all platform logic.


🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js for a modern, responsive UI.

Backend: Node.js and Express for API handling.

Blockchain: Neo blockchain and Neo Smart Contracts.

Storage: NeoFS for decentralized data storage.

Authentication: Decentralized Identity (DID) for secure, user-controlled authentication.

How to Use

1. Create a Profile: Users create their profiles using Decentralized Identity (DID).


2. Write a Blog: Compose your blog posts, which are stored on the Neo blockchain.


3. Engage: Like, comment, and share blog posts. Interaction data is decentralized and rewards users with tokens.


4. Earn Rewards: Earn tokens based on the engagement your posts receive.



📜 Smart Contracts

Post Contract: Manages user-generated content (create, update, delete posts).

Reward Contract: Handles rewards distribution based on content interactions.


💡 Inspiration

In today’s social media landscape, users often lack control over their content, and platforms may censor or remove posts without notice. We built Neonsta to give creators full ownership of their content, ensuring privacy and freedom through decentralization.
